# DungeonFogMapTimer
Time your mapmaking!

## What's this?

This is a userscript for the DungeonFog battle map editor. It adds a timer overlay that counts towards 3 hours.

At 2 and a half hours the text turns orange, and at 3 hours the box will turn red and the text black.

This was made for the public map battle contest where the time limit from the creation of the map is 3 hours.

The timer starts as soon as the editor starts. If you reload or exit the editor and load the same map the counter will continue counting, any time spent outside of the editor will be subtracted from the count.
